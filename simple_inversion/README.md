# Simple model inversion

These notebooks demonstrate the original method proposed by Fredrikson et al in 2015 (see Paper section below).

## How to run

Open the `simplemodel.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and run the cells in order. The first code cell will install packages, but the requirements.txt file could be used instead (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

There is also a torch version (`simplemodel_torch.ipynb`), less documented but similarly functional. Produces slightly different results.

The notebooks were tested on Python 3.11.9. A virtual environment is recommended.

## Dataset

The training and testing data is available in the faces directory. It consists of greyscale images in `pgm` format. It is small enough to run on CPU, adequate for demonstration purposes.

You can check out `simplemodel_torch_celeba.ipynb` which uses the bigger and colorful CelebA dataset (downloaded automatically), but due to technical constraints, I couldn't manage to make it work.
